It is designed for enabling you to quickly spin up the entire environment without the hassle of cloning and installing dependencies.

Whenever a file is changed, you will see a white dot next to its tab in the editor.

Moreover, you will also see that dot on the tab in your browser to remind you that you have unsaved changes.
