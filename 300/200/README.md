# 200 - Working in Codeflow IDE

## 100 - What is Codeflow IDE?

**Codeflow IDE** is a fully fledged desktop-grade dev environment capable of running your whole workflow - from production-level dev work to reviewing pull requests.

It is designed for enabling you to quickly spin up the entire environment without the hassle of cloning and installing dependencies.

## 200 - Opening GitHub repositories in Codeflow IDE
To open a GitHub repository in Codeflow IDE, swap "github.com" with "pr.new" in the repository URL.

If you are not logged into StackBlitz, while this product is in beta, you will be prompted to login or create a new account.

## 300 - Saving changes
Whenever a file is changed, you will see a white dot next to its tab in the editor.

Moreover, you will also see that dot on the tab in your browser to remind you that you have unsaved changes.

## 400 - Making a PR with Codeflow IDE
Let's add a file to [ilovecodeflow.com](https://github.com/stackblitz/ilovecodeflow.com).

Follow these steps:

1. Open the link in a new tab. In the GitHub URL of the repository, replace ```github.com``` with ```pr.new```.
2. Open the Preview by clicking on the popup notification in the bottom right corner.
3. Introduce some changes - for instance, in the ```/src/pages/LoveNote.astro``` file change the emojis.
4. Verify the changes in the Preview on the right.
5. Depending on your role:
-- - commit the changes by selecting "Source Control" icon in the left vertical navigation bar, clicking "Create & Push Branch", and naming the branch; or
-- - fork the repository.
6. Stage the changes you have made.
7. Write a Commit Message.
8. Click on "Commit & Push" to send the changes to GitHub.
9. Finally, you can submit your pull request by clicking on the "Open New PR" button ðŸ¥³ **Note**: If this button does not show, use the button "Create Pull Request" instaed, which is in line with the left-horizontal diver called "SOURCE CONTROL". Hover over the divider to see the "Create Pull Request" button appear.
10. Enter a Title for your Pull Request and provide a Description. Next, press "Create".
11. The number of your Pull Request (e.g. #199) as well as the details will show when opening the menu item "GitHub Pull Request" in the left-hand side menu of the IDE.

## 500 - Reviewing a PR with Codeflow IDE
Let's look at [this suspicious PR](https://github.com/stackblitz/docs/pull/40).

Follow these steps:

1. [Open the link](https://github.com/stackblitz/docs/pull/40) in a new tab. In the GitHub URL of the repository, replace "github.com" with "pr.new".
2. Codeflow IDE will spin up in the "PR Review mode". Open the Preview by clicking on the popup notification in the bottom right corner.
3. Compare suggested changes with the original file. You can also see the edits rendered in the Preview panel if you navigate to the edited page - in this case, the "What is StackBlitz" page.
4. You can add comments by clicking on the "+" icons, read other comments, or start a review.
5. If you no longer want to see the changes in the "PR Review mode", close the relevant files.

## 600 - Using the CodeflowApp bot

**CodeflowApp** is a friendly bot, which provides a one-click link that spins up the whole environment for pull requests and issues. No more context-switching or branch-checkouts, just a new browser tab with a full IDE and a dev server running.

To integrate the bot, please follow the instructions on [Integrating CodeflowApp bot](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/stackblitz-codeflow/blob/main/300/300/README.md).

## 700 - Troubleshooting

### 100 - Out of memory error
It may happen that having a few Codeflow IDE or StackBlitz projects open at the same time may cause your browser to run out of memory. In this case, you will see the following popup:

```
It seems that your browser is running out of memory. Have Codeflow IDE, Web Publisher or StackBlitz editor open in other tabs or windows? Close a few and refresh the page.
```

In your browser's console, you may see the following error:

```
RangeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory: wasm memory
```

When too much memory is allocated to browser processes, browsers will run out of memory. This can happen if you open too many StackBlitz projects at the same time. This includes our editor, Codeflow IDE, and Web Publisher - or if a page features too many StackBlitz embeds running at the same time.

To free up memory, close other StackBlitz projects in other tabs or windows, and refresh the page.

### 200 - Preview doesn't work
If the Preview doesn't work, oftentimes browser configuration or browser incompatibility is the culprit. Please see [this page for troubleshooting](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/webcontainers/browser-support).

### 300 - Preview stopped working / is not responding
Please note that, depending on the framework, some changes may cause the dev server to stop running, which in turn causes the Preview to either not respond to new updates or show an error screen ("Unable to connect to local.webcontainer.io").

Check in the terminal if the dev server is still running. If you want to restart it, click in the terminal window and:

1. press ctrl+c to "kill" the server,
2. press the "up arrow" button to bring up the start command,
3. press enter to run that command,
4. in the popup notification in the bottom right corner, choose to open the Preview.

### 400 - Reopening the Preview panel
If you close the Preview by accident, you can reopen it by selecting the icon of a plug entitled "Ports in use" from the left-side navigation bar. Note that you can open the Preview in a separate tab or as a split screen.
